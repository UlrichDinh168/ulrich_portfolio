    bio: "My name is Duong Dinh. After graduating from a university in Finland, I am quite focused on making my career in the Web development sector, especially in creating Web pages with feature-rich user experience and a beautiful interface. I have built several web applications using React/Redux as well as some of the related software. I have joined a start-up company, which I learned a lot of skills. Having the access to the codebase from various projects, I had a chance to observe other developer's coding styling, tips and tricks, and how to work as a team member in a large project. I'm currently seeking opportunities and challenges in a product company, and of course, new mentors that I can learn from :D.",
